As they moved together in a frenzy of passion, Lucius knew that he was lost to Scarlet forever. Their love was a journey into the unknown, a dance with the devil himself. But he would follow her into the darkest depths of their desire, for he knew that with her, he had found the one thing he had been searching for all his life: true love.

And as they lay there, panting and spent, Lucius knew that he would do anything to keep Scarlet by his side, to explore the depths of their passion together. For in her arms, he had found a love that was as fierce and unyielding as the flames of hell itself. And he would do anything to keep it burning bright.
