# Operation Silent Night - After Action Report

## Confidential

Operative: Natalia Kaine
Target: [REDACTED], Nexus Intelligence Agency
Date: 4242.220

### Mission Objective

Eliminate potential whistleblower within the Nexus Intelligence Agency without raising suspicion.

### Execution

1. Infiltrated target's residence at 0200 hours using advanced cloaking technology.
2. Administered untraceable neurotoxin via aerosol delivery system.
3. Staged scene to appear as natural causes (heart failure).
4. Planted false evidence suggesting target was under stress due to gambling debts.

### Outcome

Mission accomplished. Target eliminated with no signs of foul play. Local authorities have ruled the death as natural causes.

### Challenges

1. Target's home security system was more advanced than intel suggested. Overcame using quantum decryption tools.
2. Unexpected presence of target's pet AI companion. Temporarily disabled using EMP burst.

### Recommendations

1. Update our intelligence on Nexus officials' home security systems.
2. Develop better countermeasures for AI companions.

### Next Steps

1. Monitor media and NIA internal communications for any signs of suspicion.
2. Begin operation to insert our agent into the now-vacant NIA position.

Awaiting further instructions.
