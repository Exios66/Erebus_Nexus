# The Great Credit Collapse of 2145

## Overview

The Great Credit Collapse of 2145 was a significant financial crisis that shook the foundations of the Erebus Nexus economy. Nephilim Finance Group, one of the largest financial institutions in the Olympus Tier, played a central role in both the lead-up to and the aftermath of this catastrophic event.

## Key Events

1. **Credit Bubble Formation**: In the years leading up to 2145, Nephilim Finance Group aggressively expanded its credit offerings, particularly in the Machine Layer and upper Sinking Slums.

2. **AI Trading Algorithm Malfunction**: On March 15, 2145, a critical error in Nephilim's AI-driven trading algorithms caused a cascade of bad trades, resulting in massive losses.

3. **Credit Freeze**: As news of Nephilim's losses spread, other financial institutions began to withhold credit, leading to a system-wide liquidity crisis.

4. **Economic Ripple Effects**: The credit freeze quickly spread from the Olympus Tier to the lower layers, causing widespread economic disruption.

5. **Government Intervention**: The Council was forced to intervene, implementing emergency measures to prevent a complete economic collapse.

## Aftermath

- Nephilim Finance Group underwent a major restructuring, with several high-level executives facing criminal charges.
- New regulations were implemented to prevent similar AI-driven financial catastrophes in the future.
- The crisis led to a widening of the wealth gap between the Olympus Tier and lower layers of Erebus Nexus.

## Long-term Consequences

The Great Credit Collapse of 2145 had lasting effects on the Erebus Nexus economy and society, influencing everything from financial regulations to public trust in AI systems. It remains a pivotal moment in the history of the Nexus, often referenced in discussions about economic policy and corporate responsibility.
