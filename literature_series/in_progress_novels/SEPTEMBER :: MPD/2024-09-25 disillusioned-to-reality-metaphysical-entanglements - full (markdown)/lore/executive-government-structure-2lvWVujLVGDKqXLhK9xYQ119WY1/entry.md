The Council of Equity consists of three chambers, each ostensibly designed to represent a different aspect of society. However, in reality, these chambers exist primarily to give the illusion of representation and balance, while serving the interests of the corporations.

1\. The Citizen Assembly (Public Representatives)

Role: The face of the government’s “democratic” structure, the Citizen Assembly is a large body of elected officials who are meant to represent the will of the people. Citizens from across Erebus Nexus—whether from the Sky Layer, Midcity, or even the Undercity—are theoretically able to vote for representatives who will speak for their interests.

Reality: The elections for the Citizen Assembly are tightly controlled by the robber baron corporations. Corporate-backed candidates dominate the political landscape, as the corporations fund massive campaigns for candidates who will vote in line with their interests. Media coverage (controlled by DataDyne) heavily favors corporate-aligned candidates, ensuring that the Assembly is packed with corporate puppets.

Function: The Citizen Assembly’s debates and decisions are little more than performative acts, designed to give the illusion of civic engagement. When they pass legislation, it is already pre-determined by the corporate oligarchs.

2\. The Tribunal of Equity (Corporate Senate)

Role: This chamber is presented as a council of industry leaders and technocrats, supposedly made up of experts who advise the government on matters of economy, technology, and infrastructure. They are portrayed as neutral technocrats who provide expert recommendations for the good of society.

Reality: The Tribunal of Equity is a corporate-controlled body, made up of executives from Kronos Industries, MachinaTec, and DataDyne Corp., as well as other corporate allies. They hold the real power within the government, often overruling the Citizen Assembly through “emergency powers” or “economic crisis measures,” ensuring that every policy benefits their monopolistic hold on the city-planet.

Function: The Tribunal can block or shape any legislation that threatens corporate interests. Any proposed law that doesn’t align with corporate objectives is struck down, often through complex bureaucratic procedures or the use of veto powers.

3\. The Chancellor’s Court (Executive Branch)

Role: The Chancellor’s Court serves as the executive branch of the government, led by the Chancellor of Equity, who is elected by both the Citizen Assembly and the Tribunal of Equity. The Chancellor is presented as a neutral, authoritative figure who oversees the enforcement of laws, the running of government services, and the balance between corporate and public interests.

Reality: The Chancellor is always a corporate loyalist, either a former high-ranking executive from one of the monopolies or someone with deep corporate ties. The Chancellor has been bought long before their “election,” and they serve as the direct link between the government and the corporate rulers, rubber-stamping corporate-friendly laws, dismantling regulatory efforts, and making sure corporate objectives are met without resistance.

Function: The Chancellor’s Court runs government services, but these services are often heavily privatized, outsourced to the very corporations they are meant to regulate. This allows corporations like MachinaTec to control public infrastructure, DataDyne to monitor citizens under the guise of “security,” and Kronos to keep the population in a state of dependence on their resources.

Key Mechanisms of Corporate Control:

1\. Corporate Lobbying and Financial Leverage

While the Council of Equity presents itself as a balanced system, corporations control nearly every aspect of the legislative process through intense lobbying, bribery, and financial pressure. Every representative in the Citizen Assembly relies on corporate donations to fund their campaigns, and corporate lobbying groups draft much of the legislation that is “debated” within the government. The Triad of Corporations—Kronos, MachinaTec, and DataDyne—ensure that no law is passed without their approval.

Lobbying Firms: These firms, directly funded by the triad, operate as “policy advisors,” drafting legislation that favors their monopolistic practices while sabotaging any regulatory efforts that might limit their power.

Financial Blackmail: Any politician who dares to oppose the corporations is quietly silenced through financial blackmail or political ruin. DataDyne uses its vast surveillance network to gather compromising information on political rivals, while Kronos and MachinaTec threaten economic sanctions or withdraw funding from rebellious districts.

2\. Controlled Information (Media Monopoly)

DataDyne Corp. controls all major news outlets, communications, and public messaging within Erebus Nexus, ensuring that the narrative is carefully controlled. The public is bombarded with pro-government, pro-corporate messaging, portraying the Council of Equity as an effective, balanced system that serves the people’s interests.

Propaganda: The media pushes stories of false victories and fabricated achievements of the government. When the Citizen Assembly “passes” laws or reforms, the media praises the “will of the people,” while hiding the fact that these laws were pre-approved by the corporate powers.

Censorship: Any whistleblowers, journalists, or activists who attempt to expose the true nature of the corporate government are censored, silenced, or, in extreme cases, made to disappear. DataDyne’s control of information ensures that dissent never reaches the public’s ears.

3\. Economic Dependence (Monopoly Enforcement)

Kronos Industries and MachinaTec ensure that the population is economically dependent on their services. Kronos controls all energy resources, while MachinaTec monopolizes cybernetic enhancements and manufacturing. The government is fully integrated into this system of economic control, ensuring that the population is trapped in a cycle of dependence.

Privatization of Public Services: Public services like education, healthcare, and even law enforcement are largely privatized, with contracts awarded to corporations. MachinaTec, for instance, runs public hospitals where cybernetic augmentations are often required for basic medical care. Citizens must take out loans to receive these services, indebting them to corporate-run institutions for life.

Economic Policies: The Council of Equity’s economic policies are designed to protect corporate monopolies. Anti-competition laws are nonexistent, and any attempts to create new industries or services that threaten the triad’s control are crushed.

4\. Surveillance and Social Control

DataDyne’s control of the communications and surveillance infrastructure ensures that every citizen is monitored at all times. Personal data is collected, analyzed, and sold to the government and corporations, who use it to manipulate public behavior and ensure compliance.

Social Credit System: The Council of Equity, in partnership with DataDyne, runs a social credit system that tracks citizens’ behavior and rewards or punishes them accordingly. Those who conform to the government’s standards—paying their corporate debts on time, avoiding protests, and maintaining “virtuous” behavior—receive better housing and job opportunities. Those who dissent or fall behind on payments are penalized, their credit scores lowered, and their access to services cut off.

Surveillance Drones: In the Midcity and Undercity, surveillance drones patrol the streets, recording every movement and reporting suspicious activity back to the central government. Citizens are aware that they are always being watched, leading to a culture of fear and compliance.

Public Facade vs. Reality:

Public Facade:

The Council of Equity is marketed as a balanced government system that serves the people of Erebus Nexus. The Citizen Assembly represents democracy in action, the Tribunal of Equity ensures that expert voices are heard, and the Chancellor’s Court keeps the entire system running smoothly.

Public service campaigns emphasize the “shared prosperity” of the government and the corporations, pushing the narrative that the triad is essential to the city’s survival and growth. Citizens are encouraged to trust the system and believe that their voices matter.

Reality:

Behind the scenes, the robber baron corporations—Kronos Industries, MachinaTec Industries, and DataDyne Corp.—control every aspect of the government. Through financial manipulation, lobbying, and surveillance, they maintain absolute power over the economy, politics, and society.

The Council is little more than a puppet, used to pacify the masses and give the illusion of representation while reinforcing corporate control over Erebus Nexus.

Key Features of the Puppet Government:

False Representation: The Citizen Assembly is filled with corporate-backed candidates who present themselves as “the voice of the people,” but in reality, every vote is dictated by corporate interests. Even the few independent candidates who manage to secure seats are quickly overwhelmed by the corrupt system.

Corporate Legislation: Every law passed by the government is pre-approved by the robber baron corporations, ensuring that no regulation threatens their monopolies. Policies that benefit the corporations—such as deregulation, anti-union measures, and tax breaks—are pushed through with little resistance.

Ritualized Democracy: The government holds regular elections, but these are carefully choreographed. Voter turnout is manipulated, with the public led to believe that their votes matter, even though the outcome is pre-determined by corporate influence.

Public Pacification: Through controlled media, surveillance, and propaganda, the government keeps the population pacified. Citizens are constantly reassured that they live in a just, virtuous society, even as their rights and freedoms are stripped away in service of corporate power.

This puppet government system fits seamlessly into the power structure of Erebus Nexus, propping up the robber baron corporations while maintaining the illusion of balance and democracy. Behind its illustrious exterior lies a hollow core of corporate domination, where the triad of corporations uses their economic, technological, and political power to exploit the city-planet for their own gain, ensuring that Erebus Nexus remains a world built on greed, control, and manipulation.
