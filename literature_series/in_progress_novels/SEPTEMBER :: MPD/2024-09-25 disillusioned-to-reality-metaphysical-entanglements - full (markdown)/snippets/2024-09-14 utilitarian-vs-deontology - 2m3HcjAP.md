title: Utilitarian Vs Deontology

---
Utilitarianism, the philosophical doctrine advocating that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, or the greatest good for the greatest number, has been challenged repeatedly across literature, film, plays, and other media by contrasting philosophical ideologies, particularly Kantian deontology and virtue ethics. These narratives often expose the moral imperfections of utilitarianism when confronted with individual rights, moral absolutism, or the complexities of ethical dilemmas. Below are a few examples and notable instances, alongside how they could inform the narrative construction within _Erebus Nexus_:

\---

\### **1\. Fyodor Dostoevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_**

\- **Challenge to Utilitarianism**: Dostoevsky's novel is one of the most famous literary challenges to utilitarian ethics, particularly through Ivan Karamazov’s “Rebellion.” Ivan argues that no amount of happiness in the world can justify the suffering of even a single innocent child, directly opposing utilitarian notions that sacrificing the few for the good of the many is morally permissible.

\- **Kantian Deontological Influence**: Ivan’s refusal to accept any utilitarian justification for suffering aligns with deontological ethics, particularly Kantian views that each person is an end in themselves and should never be used as a mere means to an end.

\- **Application in _Erebus Nexus_**: This conflict can be echoed within _Erebus Nexus_ by showing the moral collapse of a society that embraces utilitarianism at the cost of individual suffering. The challenge could come from a deontologically driven figure or organization that rejects any cost-benefit analysis, insisting on the inviolability of human dignity, even in a deteriorating world.

\### **2\. William Shakespeare’s _Measure for Measure_**

\- **Challenge to Utilitarianism**: Shakespeare's play explores the clash between justice, morality, and mercy. The deputy ruler Angelo enforces strict moral laws with no room for mercy, assuming a quasi-utilitarian position that the greater good (societal moral uprightness) outweighs the harm caused to individuals.

\- **Virtue Ethics Influence**: The Duke, in contrast, argues for mercy, a more virtue-ethical approach. He suggests that enforcing moral laws strictly without considering individual circumstances creates greater harm than good, thus critiquing utilitarianism’s rigid application in the pursuit of collective benefit.

\- **Application in _Erebus Nexus_**: A power struggle between enforcers of a utilitarian regime, intent on sacrificing individual freedom for the sake of societal preservation, and virtue-ethicists who believe in the preservation of individual rights and personal development, would make for a compelling narrative. This could reflect the ethical tension within a monopolistic power structure within Erebus.

\### **3\. Ursula K. Le Guin’s _The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas_**

\- **Challenge to Utilitarianism**: In this short story, Le Guin presents a utopian society whose happiness depends on the suffering of a single child, much like a utilitarian calculus where the good of the majority outweighs the suffering of the few. However, the story sharply critiques this notion by focusing on the individuals who choose to leave Omelas upon learning of the child's suffering.

\- **Deontological & Existential Influence**: The decision to walk away aligns with Kantian deontology, where moral absolutes reject the instrumentalization of human beings, as well as existentialism, where individuals exercise their moral agency to reject systems of oppression, no matter the societal consequence.

\- **Application in _Erebus Nexus_**: This tension could play out within _Erebus Nexus_ as characters or factions confront the ethical compromises of their society. A morally unyielding group, driven by deontological principles, may attempt to dismantle systems that sacrifice individuals for the "greater good," echoing the story's critique of utilitarian compromises.

\### **4\. Christopher Nolan’s _The Dark Knight_**

\- **Challenge to Utilitarianism**: The moral dilemma of whether to destroy one boat filled with criminals to save another with civilians presents a clear utilitarian conflict. Batman refuses to let anyone die, rejecting the idea that sacrificing some for the greater good is justifiable.

\- **Virtue Ethics & Deontological Influence**: Batman's decision to save both boats reflects a deontological rejection of utilitarianism’s harsh moral calculus, aligning with virtue ethics that emphasizes moral character and the refusal to compromise personal integrity, even for the sake of larger outcomes.

\- **Application in _Erebus Nexus_**: In a world like _Erebus Nexus,_ this ethical dilemma could manifest in decisions made by corporate or governmental figures who must weigh the destruction of entire sectors or virtual realities for the preservation of a few privileged spaces. Characters like a vigilante hero or antihero could embody this moral refusal to accept utilitarian costs, creating a deep philosophical tension.

\### **5\. Robert Bolt’s _A Man for All Seasons_**

\- **Challenge to Utilitarianism**: The play tells the story of Sir Thomas More, who chooses to sacrifice himself rather than endorse King Henry VIII’s divorce. More’s refusal is an assertion of moral integrity over the expedient solution that would benefit the kingdom—a clear challenge to utilitarianism.

\- **Kantian Deontology Influence**: More’s actions reflect Kant’s categorical imperative, as he refuses to compromise his principles, even at the cost of his life, asserting that moral laws are universal and cannot be bent for the sake of societal utility.

\- **Application in _Erebus Nexus_**: An incorruptible figure in _Erebus Nexus_ could parallel More, standing against a utilitarian system that demands ethical compromises for the “greater good” of the Nexus. Their resistance could inspire others, catalyzing a deeper ethical struggle that destabilizes the system's moral legitimacy.

\### **Narrative Application for _Erebus Nexus_**

The philosophical confrontation of utilitarianism in _Erebus Nexus_ could serve as the backbone for a dynamic conflict between corporate or societal entities prioritizing efficiency, optimization, and maximal benefit against factions or individuals who uphold human dignity, moral integrity, or virtue. By weaving in deontological figures or virtue ethicists who refuse to accept the moral calculus of utilitarianism, the narrative can explore how utilitarian ethics, when taken to extremes, lead to societal collapse, moral alienation, and the dehumanization of individuals. This moral tension will allow for intricate character development and the exploration of resistance movements against the utilitarian order, positioning the philosophy’s imperfections as the cause of broader societal issues within the world of Erebus.
