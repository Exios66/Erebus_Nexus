Description\*\*: \_Erebus Nexus\_ is a sprawling planet-sized city, the economic and political heart of the galaxy. It represents the ultimate fusion of \*\*cyberpunk dystopia\*\* with a galaxy-spanning empire. The city rises in endless layers—glimmering towers above, slums in the depths. The planet itself is a complex of artificial habitats and mega-structures built on a dead, long-forgotten planet core. Inhabitants range from the hyper-elite to scavengers eking out a life in the underbelly, where access to air, light, and even space is limited.

\*\*Themes\*\*: \_Surveillance State\_, \_Corporate Dominance\_, \_Technocratic Governance\_.

\- \*\*Upper Tiers\*\*: Home to the \*Technocrat Overlords\* and the galaxy’s ruling corporate elite. They live in ivory towers, surrounded by cutting-edge luxury, clean environments, and virtual utopias.

\- \*\*Lower Depths (The Undercity)\*\*: These areas are controlled by crime syndicates, rogue AI factions, and the forgotten masses who rely on hacked life-support systems. People live among the refuse of society, beneath a literal ceiling of steel.

\*\*Intergalactic Nexus\*\*: This planet is a \*\*hub for interstellar travel\*\*, with massive spaceports connecting to wormhole gates that transport goods and people across the galaxy. Each layer of the city corresponds to economic tiers, with only the wealthiest able to afford direct intergalactic travel.

\*\*Architecture\*\*: Neon-lit streets, massive holographic advertisements, and monolithic megacorporate towers contrast with decaying industrial sectors. Buildings are patchworked with cables, metal, and retrofit tech.
