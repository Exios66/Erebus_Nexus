"Can you fathom this scene?" Finn positioned himself next to her, his palms buried deep within his trouser pockets. He nudged a pebble, propelling it across the concrete. "It used to teem with activity."

"Sure, but activity has an odd knack for vanishing," Ava responded, her gaze sweeping the skyline. The breeze carried hints of corrosion and rot, a telltale sign of what lurked beneath.

Finn shrugged, brushing his locks away from his brow. "Think there's anyone left?"

Ava shook her head. "Not after the incident. They'd have fled."

Ava inhaled deeply, the gravity of his statement settling upon her. She faced him once more, searching his gaze for something she couldn't quite pinpoint. "Very well, but if we're embarking on this, we remain united. No separating."

"Agreed." A hesitant grin broke through his earlier vexation, a glimmer of optimism igniting amidst the desolation.
