# The Barter and Scrip Economy of the Sinking Slums

## Overview

The Barter and Scrip Economy (BSE) is the primary economic system of the Sinking Slums in Erebus Nexus. Born out of necessity and scarcity, this hybrid system combines direct trade of goods and services with localized scrip currencies. The BSE reflects the resourcefulness and adaptability of the Sinking Slums' inhabitants, creating a fluid and resilient economy in the face of extreme hardship.

## Key Features

### 1. Barter System

At its core, the BSE relies heavily on the direct exchange of goods and services. This system allows for flexibility and immediate fulfillment of needs in an environment where traditional currency is scarce.

### 2. Local Scrip Currencies

Various local scrip currencies circulate within different sectors of the Sinking Slums. These are often backed by community resources, gang influence, or specific valuable commodities.

### 3. Value Fluctuation

The value of goods, services, and scrip in the BSE can fluctuate rapidly based on immediate needs, resource availability, and local events.

### 4. Skill-Based Trading

Individual skills and abilities are highly valued in the BSE, with services often traded directly for goods or other services.

### 5. Salvage Economy

A significant portion of the BSE revolves around the trade and repurposing of salvaged materials and technology from upper tiers.
