1\. Law Enforcement: “Aegis Tactical Defense Solutions”

Tagline: “Protection is a Premium.”

Service Overview:

In Erebus Nexus, law enforcement is synonymous with private military contractors. The official law enforcement agency, known as Aegis Tactical Defense Solutions, operates as a for-profit organization. While marketed as a public service designed to keep the peace, Aegis is actually a highly militarized force that functions on a tier-based subscription model. The wealthier citizens of Erebus Nexus pay exorbitant fees for rapid-response protection, while the lower classes are left to fend for themselves unless they can afford one-time intervention fees—a rare occurrence.

Service Tiers:

Platinum Tier:

Cost: Astronomically expensive, available only to the corporate elite and residents of the Sky Layer.

Service: Full-time protection with personal bodyguards, AI-assisted surveillance drones, and heavily armed tactical teams on standby. Response time is instantaneous, with tactical exosuits deployed to neutralize threats within minutes. Every movement is monitored to ensure the safety of the client.

Special Features: Clients can preemptively neutralize threats, allowing for "preventative" takedowns of individuals who may pose a potential danger in the future, determined by AI surveillance.

Gold Tier:

Cost: Extremely high, accessible to upper-middle-class individuals and mid-level corporate employees.

Service: Priority access to rapid-response teams within 10 minutes. Clients are given limited drone surveillance and localized defense systems for their homes or businesses, though not on the scale of Platinum Tier. Tactical teams are dispatched only when threats are classified as "verified danger" by AI algorithms.

Silver Tier:

Cost: High, affordable only to wealthier members of the middle class.

Service: Standard law enforcement with 30-minute response times. Clients can request military-grade assistance, but only for serious incidents that pass a cost-benefit analysis by Aegis’s AI systems. Coverage includes basic monitoring but no active surveillance.

Extra Fees: Additional charges apply for use of firearms, non-lethal measures, or excessive use of force.

Bronze Tier:

Cost: Barely affordable for lower-middle-class citizens.

Service: Response times range from 1-2 hours, depending on the severity of the crime. Drone surveillance may be offered, but AI systems will prioritize higher-paying clients. In most cases, Bronze Tier subscribers are left waiting for hours or must pay on-the-spot upgrade fees for faster response.

Pay-Per-Intervention:

Cost: Varies per service.

Service: For those unable to afford a subscription, one-time intervention fees are charged for emergency assistance, often crippling in cost. Citizens must pay for on-the-spot protection, ranging from minor conflict resolution to full-scale tactical intervention.

Corporate Control and Public Impact:

Aegis operates like a corporate army, with its primary focus being the protection of corporate assets and high-net-worth individuals. Lower-income citizens are often left unprotected, leading to widespread crime in the lower levels of Erebus Nexus, where gang violence and rogue AI often go unchecked. This disparity is carefully covered up by Lucid Enclave through glorified advertisements showing Aegis’s elite protection services in glamorous situations, perpetuating the illusion of universal safety.
