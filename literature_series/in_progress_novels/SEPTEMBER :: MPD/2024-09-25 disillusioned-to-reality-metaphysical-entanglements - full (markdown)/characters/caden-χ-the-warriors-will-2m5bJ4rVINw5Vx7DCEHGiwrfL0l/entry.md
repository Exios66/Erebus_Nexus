Caden (χ) - The Warrior’s Will

Symbolism in the Morningstar Virtue Theory:

Caden represents stoicism, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. He is the embodiment of the Morningstar Virtue Theory’s ideal of bravery and determination, where honor and loyalty to the group are paramount. His struggle lies in balancing his instinct for battle with the virtues of unity and self-restraint.

Unique Contributions:

Caden is the group’s defender, always the first to charge into battle. His sheer physical strength makes him a powerful force against corporate forces, and his unwavering loyalty to the group often inspires others to push forward. However, his aggression and impatience sometimes lead him to act rashly, putting others at risk.

Physical Form Description:

Caden’s form is massive and imposing, with a thick, armored shell of dark steel and crimson energy coursing through the cracks in his armor. His face is shaped like a helmet, with piercing red eyes that glow intensely when he’s enraged. His fists are the size of hammers, and his movements are heavy, causing the ground to tremble beneath him. His form is scarred from previous battles, with deep dents and cracks running along his armor, giving him a worn, battle-hardened appearance.
