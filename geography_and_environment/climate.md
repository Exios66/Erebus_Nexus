# Climate of Erebus Nexus

The climate of Erebus Nexus is a complex interplay of artificial environmental control and the influence of its massive structure on local weather patterns. The city's vertical design creates unique microclimates across different tiers and sectors.

## General Climate Characteristics

- **Temperature Control**: Advanced climate regulation systems maintain comfortable temperatures throughout most of the city, with variations between tiers.

- **Precipitation Management**: Rainfall is carefully controlled and recycled through the city's water management systems.

- **Air Quality**: Sophisticated filtration systems ensure breathable air, with quality varying between tiers.

## Tier-Specific Climate Conditions

### Olympus Tier

- Near-perfect climate control
- Customizable environmental settings in private residences
- Access to open-air spaces with filtered, pollution-free atmosphere

### Machine Layer

- Regulated temperature for optimal machine operation
- Higher humidity levels due to industrial processes
- Strictly controlled atmosphere to prevent equipment damage

### Residential Tiers

- Gradually decreasing climate control quality in lower tiers
- More exposed to external weather influences in outer sections
- Microclimates formed by the interaction of built structures and air currents

### Sinking Slums

- Minimal climate control
- Exposed to temperature extremes and unfiltered air
- Prone to moisture accumulation and mold growth

### The Sprawl

- Varied microclimates due to improvised structures and repurposed spaces
- Some areas with community-managed climate control systems
- More exposed to external weather patterns

## Weather Phenomena

- **Vertical Wind Tunnels**: Strong air currents between structures, particularly dangerous in lower tiers
- **Acid Rain**: Occasional occurrences in lower tiers due to industrial pollutants
- **Fog Banks**: Artificial cloud formations at certain levels, sometimes used for atmospheric effect in upper tiers
- **Heat Islands**: Pockets of elevated temperatures, especially in densely populated or industrial areas

## Environmental Challenges

- **Climate Stratification**: Increasing temperature and air quality disparities between upper and lower tiers
- **Waste Heat Management**: Dealing with excess heat from industrial and residential activities
- **Water Cycle Disruption**: Artificial rain patterns and water recycling affecting natural hydrological processes

The climate of Erebus Nexus is a testament to human engineering and adaptation, but also a source of ongoing environmental challenges and social inequalities.
