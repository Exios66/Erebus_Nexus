# Cyberpsychosis Outbreak: Prometheus Innovations' Covert Human Experimentation

## Overview

The Cyberpsychosis Outbreak of 2148 was a carefully orchestrated event by Prometheus Innovations, designed to advance their AI augmentation and neural weaponization programs while maintaining public deniability. This case study details the true nature of the outbreak, its causes, and the elaborate cover-up operation involving the AI Ethics Commission (AIEC).

## Public Narrative

In 2148, several cybernetic-enhanced individuals began displaying signs of cyberpsychosis, a previously unknown condition that caused violent, erratic behavior among those implanted with advanced Prometheus AI neural systems. Prometheus Innovations immediately took responsibility for containing the outbreak, offering extensive research into the neurological impact of AI-human integration and providing emergency medical care. The AI Ethics Commission (AIEC) conducted a thorough investigation and concluded that Prometheus was not responsible for the outbreak, citing unforeseen genetic factors as the cause.

## Shadow Operations

### True Causes

1. Unregulated experiments in extreme AI augmentation
2. Covert neural weaponization program
3. Deliberate inducement of psychosis in test subjects to study combat effectiveness

### Execution

1. Selected test subjects from various social strata to ensure diverse data
2. Implemented trigger mechanisms to activate cyberpsychosis remotely
3. Staged "random" outbreaks to test public response and containment protocols

### Cover-up Operation

1. Activated sleeper agents within the AIEC to control the investigation
2. Fabricated genetic evidence to support the "unforeseen factors" narrative
3. Silenced or eliminated potential whistleblowers and affected individuals

## Key Figures

- **Dr. Elara Vex**: Lead scientist of Prometheus's neural augmentation program
- **Chief Inspector Hadrian Lorne**: AIEC official, secretly working for Prometheus

## Outcomes

1. Advanced understanding of human-AI integration limits
2. Developed new methods for neural control and manipulation
3. Increased public acceptance of Prometheus as a leader in AI safety
4. Secured additional funding for "safety research" and augmentation programs

## Lessons Learned

1. The effectiveness of using public health scares to advance covert research
2. The importance of controlling regulatory bodies for successful cover-ups
3. The value of staged "failures" in building public trust and deflecting suspicion

## Future Implications

The success of the Cyberpsychosis operation has paved the way for more ambitious human experimentation projects. Prometheus Innovations now has a tested framework for conducting extreme augmentation research with minimal risk of exposure or legal consequences.
