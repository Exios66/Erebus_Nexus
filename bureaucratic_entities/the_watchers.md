## The Intelligence Division: The Silent Watchers

- At the heart of Erebus Nexus is its secretive intelligence division. Known only as The Watchers, this division monitors every aspect of galactic life, from corporate dealings to political movements and even personal communications.

- **~Tools of Surveillance~**: The Watchers use an array of surveillance systems, including AI-driven data-mining algorithms, black-market spyware, and drones that infiltrate every major corporation and government.

- **~The Black Vault~**: An enormous databank hidden deep within an uncharted sector, the Black Vault contains information on every important figure, government, corporation, and event. Nothing escapes its notice, and The Architects rely on it to maintain control over their vast network.
