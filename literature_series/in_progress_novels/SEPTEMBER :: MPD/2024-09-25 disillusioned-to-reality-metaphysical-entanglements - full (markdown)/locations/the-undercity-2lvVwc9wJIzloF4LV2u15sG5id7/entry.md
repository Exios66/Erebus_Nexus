Lower Depths (The Undercity)\*\*: These areas are controlled by crime syndicates, rogue AI factions, and the forgotten masses who rely on hacked life-support systems. People live among the refuse of society, beneath a literal ceiling of steel.

The Undercity draws inspiration from the neon-lit, rain-soaked streets of "Blade Runner 2049" and the dense alleyways of Chongqing. The streets are narrow and winding, with water dripping from countless leaking pipes and broken buildings. Makeshift housing towers over the ground, constructed from the remnants of old structures and repurposed technology. The sky is barely visible, hidden behind layers of debris and forgotten buildings. Neon signs flicker sporadically, casting an eerie glow on the streets, while the sound of machinery breaking down is a constant background noise. Lifestyle Life in the Undercity is a constant struggle for survival. The inhabitants, often referred to as "sinks," live in cyber poverty, dependent on outdated or scavenged technology. Many have been augmented with cybernetic enhancements, some of which are safe and reliable, while others are dangerous or defective. These augmentations are often the only way for the sinks to find work or escape the cycle of poverty. The Undercity is divided into different districts, each ruled by a different gang. These gangs are ruthless and powerful, enforcing their own laws and exacting brutal punishment on those who defy them. The sinks must navigate this dangerous world, constantly aware of the gangs that patrol the streets and the black market vendors who sell everything from illegal cyberware to stolen AI codes. Many sinks work as illegal tech-runners, scavengers, or low-level hackers. They navigate the abandoned ruins of the past, scavenging for valuable technology that can be sold or repurposed. Others work in the black market, dealing in everything from drugs to stolen goods. The Undercity is a place where the rules are different, and survival often means bending or breaking the law.

Aesthetic

The aesthetic of the Undercity is chaotic and dilapidated, a stark contrast to the order and cleanliness of the Sky Layer and the industrial efficiency of the Midcity. The buildings are old and crumbling, with walls covered in graffiti and broken windows. The streets are filled with discarded technology and debris, a testament to the relentless cycle of consumption and waste. People wear patchwork clothing, mixing futuristic tech with rags, their outfits reflecting the breakdown of society.

Neon signs flicker sporadically, casting an eerie glow on the streets, while the sound of machinery breaking down is a constant background noise. The Undercity is a place of contrasts, where the advanced technology of the future coexists with the primitive conditions of the past. It is a world of shadows and secrets, where the line between life and death is razor-thin.

In conclusion, the Undercity (The Sinking Slums) is a world of survival and struggle, a place where the remnants of society scrape by in the shadows of the city's towering megastructures. It is a realm of chaos and lawlessness, ruled by gangs and black market vendors, where the line between life and death is razor-thin. The Undercity is a testament to the harsh realities of the Noctus Nexus, a world where technology has both uplifted and abandoned humanity.
