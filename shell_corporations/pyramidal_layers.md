# Pyramidal Layers of Shell Corporations

## Overview

The shell corporation structure within Erebus Nexus is designed as a complex, multi-layered pyramid. This structure serves to obfuscate ownership, hide illicit activities, and protect the interests of the true power brokers of the Nexus. Understanding these layers is crucial for comprehending the intricate web of corporate espionage and illegal operations that permeate the world of Erebus Nexus.

## Layer Structure

1. **Base Layer: Fronts**
   - Numerous small businesses and startups
   - Often legitimate-seeming operations in various sectors
   - High turnover rate, easily abandoned or replaced

2. **Second Layer: Intermediaries**
   - Mid-sized companies with more established presence
   - Act as buffers between fronts and higher layers
   - Engage in more complex financial transactions

3. **Third Layer: Regional Hubs**
   - Larger corporations with significant regional influence
   - Coordinate activities of lower layers within specific areas
   - Often have connections to local bureaucratic entities

4. **Fourth Layer: Sector Dominants**
   - Major players in specific industrial or economic sectors
   - Wield considerable influence over entire industries
   - Often appear as legitimate, powerful corporations

5. **Fifth Layer: Global Entities**
   - Massive multinational corporations
   - Operate across multiple economic tiers of Erebus Nexus
   - Heavily involved in shaping economic and political policies

6. **Apex: Shadow Directors**
   - True power brokers of Erebus Nexus
   - Identity and number unknown even to most high-level operatives
   - Control the entire pyramid structure through proxies and AI systems

## Operational Mechanics

- Each layer communicates primarily with the layers immediately above and below it
- Information and resource flow is strictly controlled and compartmentalized
- AI systems play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and hiding connections
- The structure allows for rapid reconfiguration in response to threats or opportunities

## Detection and Enforcement Challenges

- The complexity of the structure makes it extremely difficult for authorities to trace activities to the top
- Lower layers are designed to be sacrificial, protecting higher layers from scrutiny
- Advanced AI algorithms constantly work to obscure connections and create false leads

Understanding this pyramidal structure is key to navigating the corporate landscape of Erebus Nexus, whether as a player in the system or an investigator trying to unravel its mysteries.
