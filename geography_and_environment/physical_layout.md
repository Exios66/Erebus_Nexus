# Physical Layout of Erebus Nexus

Erebus Nexus is a massive, vertically-structured megacity designed to maximize space efficiency and resource management. Its unique architecture incorporates advanced materials and technologies to create a self-sustaining urban environment.

## Vertical Structure

1. **Olympus Tier**: The topmost level, housing the elite and corporate headquarters. Features luxurious living spaces, advanced research facilities, and pristine artificial environments.

2. **Machine Layer**: A vast network of automated factories, power generation facilities, and resource processing plants. This layer is the industrial heart of Erebus Nexus.

3. **Residential Tiers**: Multiple levels of housing, ranging from comfortable middle-class apartments to cramped lower-tier dwellings. Each tier has its own amenities, markets, and public spaces.

4. **Sinking Slums**: The lowest habitable levels, characterized by makeshift structures, recycled materials, and improvised living spaces.

5. **Forgotten Sector**: Recently discovered abandoned areas, filled with relics and structures from the early days of Erebus Nexus.

6. **The Sprawl**: A semi-autonomous zone that has developed in the outskirts and lower levels of the city, known for its diverse subcultures and alternative lifestyles.

## Key Structural Elements

- **Central Spire**: The main structural support and transportation hub of Erebus Nexus, housing high-speed elevators and serving as the primary conduit for resources and energy distribution.

- **Sky Bridges**: Massive structures connecting different sectors of the city, serving as transportation routes and hosting additional living and commercial spaces.

- **Vertical Farms**: Integrated agricultural spaces that provide a significant portion of the city's food supply, utilizing advanced hydroponics and aeroponics technologies.

- **Environmental Control Systems**: A network of air filtration, water purification, and climate regulation systems that maintain livable conditions throughout the city.

- **Energy Grid**: A complex system of power generation and distribution, including fusion reactors, solar arrays, and wind turbines integrated into the city's structure.

The physical layout of Erebus Nexus reflects its stratified society and technological advancements, creating a unique urban landscape that continues to evolve and adapt to the needs of its inhabitants.
