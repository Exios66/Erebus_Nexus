# Forgotten Sector

## Overview

The Forgotten Sector is a mysterious and dangerous area of Erebus Nexus, existing on the fringes of the megacity's structure. Once a thriving part of the city, it has been largely abandoned due to structural instability, environmental hazards, or obsolescence. The Forgotten Sector is now home to scavengers, relic hunters, and those seeking to escape the oversight of the upper tiers.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Abandoned Infrastructure**: The sector is filled with decaying buildings, forgotten technology, and remnants of past eras of Erebus Nexus.
2. **Unstable Environment**: Parts of the sector are prone to collapse, toxic spills, or unpredictable energy surges.
3. **Relic-Based Economy**: The primary economic activity revolves around the discovery, trade, and repurposing of relics from the sector's past.
4. **Limited Oversight**: The area exists largely outside the control of Erebus Nexus's governing bodies, leading to a semi-lawless state.
5. **Unique Ecosystem**: Isolated for years, the sector has developed its own ecosystem, including mutated flora and fauna.

## Relationship with Other Tiers

The Forgotten Sector has a unique relationship with the rest of Erebus Nexus:

- It serves as a source of rare materials and forgotten technology for upper tiers.
- Some corporations secretly use the sector for off-the-books research and development.
- It offers a haven for those looking to escape the rigid control of the upper tiers.
- The sector occasionally releases environmental hazards that affect neighboring areas.

## Challenges and Conflicts

Life in the Forgotten Sector is fraught with numerous challenges:

- Constant danger from structural collapses, toxic exposures, and malfunctioning technology
- Conflicts between rival relic hunter groups over valuable finds
- The ethical dilemma of disturbing potentially hazardous old technology
- Balancing the desire for independence with the need for resources from other sectors
- The psychological toll of living in an environment of constant uncertainty and danger

Despite these challenges, the Forgotten Sector attracts those who value freedom, adventure, and the thrill of discovery. It represents both the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the potential for rediscovering lost knowledge and resources.
