# Ecosystems of Erebus Nexus

Erebus Nexus hosts a variety of artificial and semi-natural ecosystems, each adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the megacity's different tiers and sectors.

## Artificial Ecosystems

### Olympus Tier Gardens

- Meticulously maintained biodomes and rooftop gardens
- Rare and exotic plant species, often genetically modified for aesthetic purposes
- Small populations of carefully selected animals, including butterflies and birds

### Vertical Farms

- Highly efficient hydroponic and aeroponic systems
- Genetically optimized crop varieties
- Controlled pollinator populations, including bees and hoverflies

### Aquaponic Systems

- Integrated fish and plant cultivation
- Found in various tiers, with higher sophistication in upper levels
- Important source of protein and fresh produce

## Semi-Natural Ecosystems

### Urban Forests

- Large-scale tree plantations in mid-tier public spaces
- Designed for air purification and psychological well-being
- Home to small animals and insects, both intentionally introduced and naturally occurring

### Reclamation Zones

- Areas where nature is allowed to reclaim abandoned or unused spaces
- Often found in the Sprawl and lower tiers
- Unique mix of native and introduced species adapting to urban conditions

### Underground Fungal Networks

- Extensive mycelium networks in the city's substructure
- Used for waste decomposition and sometimes food production
- Potential source of new medicinal compounds

## Feral Ecosystems

### Sinking Slums Biodiversity

- Unplanned and uncontrolled plant and animal communities
- Adaptive species thriving in harsh urban conditions
- Important for local food webs and unofficial waste management

### Forgotten Sector Enclaves

- Isolated ecosystems evolved from abandoned early-city biodomes
- Unique species adaptations due to long-term isolation
- Subject of interest for biologists studying urban evolution

## Ecosystem Services

- **Air Purification**: Many ecosystems, especially urban forests, play a crucial role in filtering the city's air
- **Water Cycling**: Plantations and reclamation zones assist in water purification and reduce strain on artificial recycling systems
- **Temperature Regulation**: Green spaces help mitigate urban heat island effects
- **Psychological Benefits**: Access to nature, even in artificial forms, provides mental health benefits to residents

## Challenges and Ongoing Research

- Maintaining biodiversity in isolated urban environments
- Balancing ecosystem services with space efficiency in a vertical city
- Studying and mitigating the impacts of artificial lighting and climate control on plant and animal life cycles
- Developing new strains of urban-adapted plants and animals for improved ecosystem stability

The ecosystems of Erebus Nexus represent a unique blend of natural resilience and human engineering, constantly evolving as the city grows and changes.
