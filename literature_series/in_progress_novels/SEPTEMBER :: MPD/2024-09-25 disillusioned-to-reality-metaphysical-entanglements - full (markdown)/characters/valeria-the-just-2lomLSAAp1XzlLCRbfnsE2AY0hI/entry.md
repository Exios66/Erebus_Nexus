\### \*\*Backstory:\*\*

Valeria Teris was born into a family of philosophers and educators in the \*Olympus Tier\*, where ideals of morality, virtue, and human flourishing were discussed daily at the dinner table. From a young age, she was steeped in the teachings of \*\*Aristotle\*\*, \*\*Plato\*\*, and other classical philosophers, coming to believe that the ultimate purpose of life was to achieve eudaimonia—human flourishing through virtuous living. She was a gifted orator, capable of swaying even the most hardened cynics with her passionate speeches on the importance of virtue, temperance, and moral excellence.

However, as Valeria grew older and ventured beyond the pristine confines of the Olympus Tier, she became disillusioned with what she saw in the Midcity and Undercity. She witnessed crime, greed, and moral decay at every turn, and slowly her vision of a virtuous society darkened. Rather than maintaining her belief in the inherent goodness of humanity, Valeria began to believe that \*\*virtue must be imposed\*\*—that people could not be trusted to cultivate virtue on their own. Left to their own devices, they would inevitably fall into vice. She concluded that only through \*\*absolute control\*\* and \*\*moral oversight\*\* could society achieve true virtue.

Her philosophy evolved from one of moral inspiration to one of \*\*moral tyranny\*\*. Valeria took on the title \*\*“The Just”\*\*, and through her faction, \*The Virtuous Dominion\*, she imposed her strict interpretation of virtue on those beneath her. What began as a noble vision of human flourishing turned into a rigid, authoritarian regime where those who failed to meet her impossible standards were cast out, punished, or re-educated.

\### \*\*Personality & Philosophy:\*\*

Valeria Teris is the living embodiment of \*\*corrupted virtue ethics\*\*. In her mind, she is still striving toward virtue, yet she has warped the virtues into tools of oppression and control. Instead of encouraging others to \*choose\* virtue and develop their moral character, she \*demands\* it, believing that the ends (a virtuous society) justify any means necessary. In doing so, she becomes the antithesis of virtue, a tyrant clothed in the rhetoric of moral excellence.

\*\*Key Elements of Valeria’s Philosophy:\*\*

\- \*\*Distorted Virtue:\*\* Valeria believes that traditional virtues—courage, temperance, wisdom, justice—must be upheld at all costs. However, she has twisted these virtues to suit her own tyrannical methods. For example, “courage” is no longer about facing fear with integrity but about ruthlessly enforcing her regime’s rules. “Justice” is no longer about fairness but about punishing those who do not conform to her standards.

\- \*\*Enforced Eudaimonia:\*\* Valeria still believes in the ultimate goal of eudaimonia, but she sees human flourishing as something that must be \*\*controlled\*\*. She views herself as a moral guide, but rather than encouraging people to find virtue within themselves, she forces them into her rigid definition of it.

\- \*\*Moral Elitism:\*\* She sees herself as the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes a “virtuous life,” considering herself above the common masses who, in her view, lack the wisdom and discipline to achieve virtue without her guidance. This makes her a moral elitist, convinced that only she can lead society to the true path.

\- \*\*The Ends Justify the Means:\*\* Though Valeria preaches the importance of virtue, she has adopted the Machiavellian idea that the ends justify the means. If enforcing virtue requires coercion, violence, or repression, so be it. She rationalizes any atrocity as necessary for the greater good.

\### \*\*Personality Profile:\*\*

1\. \*\*Charismatic and Manipulative:\*\* Outwardly, Valeria appears to be the epitome of a benevolent ruler—wise, just, and patient. She can inspire others with fiery speeches about the importance of morality and the need to restore society’s virtues. Her charisma draws people in, making her appear as a moral savior, but beneath this exterior lies a deeply manipulative person who twists others to her will.

2\. \*\*Self-Righteous and Delusional:\*\* Valeria is utterly convinced of the \*\*rightness\*\* of her cause. She believes herself to be the living embodiment of moral excellence, which makes her blind to her own flaws and hypocrisies. Her followers view her as a paragon of virtue, but in reality, her ego and vanity have corroded her morality from within.

3\. \*\*Cruel Benevolence:\*\* Valeria uses the language of care and compassion, but her actions are often cruel. She genuinely believes that in punishing or coercing others into virtuous behavior, she is acting in their best interest. For instance, she might have someone publicly shamed or even executed for failing to live up to her ideals, believing this is the only way to “teach” virtue.

4\. \*\*Vain and Narcissistic:\*\* Despite her lofty ideals, Valeria has developed a deep sense of narcissism. She sees herself as the \*\*ideal\*\* of human virtue, and this has led to vanity in both her personal conduct and her appearance. She wears elaborate, regal clothing adorned with symbols of virtue (golden laurels, white robes, etc.) as though she is a goddess among mere mortals.

5\. \*\*Authoritarian and Perfectionist:\*\* Valeria has no tolerance for imperfection. She demands absolute loyalty and compliance from her followers and severely punishes those who fail to meet her standards. Her authoritarian nature makes her a terrifying leader—her punishments are swift and brutal, often veiled under the guise of “moral correction.”

\### \*\*Character Elements That Make Valeria Unique:\*\*

1\. \*\*Corruption of Virtue:\*\* Unlike villains who are motivated by greed, power, or vengeance, Valeria’s motivations are rooted in her belief in the importance of virtue. What makes her unique is how she has \*corrupted\* this belief—taking something as noble as virtue and turning it into a weapon of oppression. She does not see herself as evil but as a necessary force for moral good.

2\. \*\*Twisted Mentor:\*\* Valeria often sees herself as a \*\*mentor\*\* to those who follow her. However, her mentorship is a distortion—she does not teach virtue through example or encouragement but through punishment and control. Her idea of teaching is forcing others into submission until they adhere to her standards.

3\. \*\*The Hollow Paragon:\*\* Though Valeria claims to represent the epitome of virtue, her actions reveal that she is hollow inside. She is the \*\*antithesis\*\* of the virtues she espouses. Her courage is reckless tyranny, her wisdom is arrogance, and her justice is cruelty.

4\. \*\*False Benevolence:\*\* Valeria’s greatest weapon is her ability to appear as a \*\*benevolent ruler\*\*. She cloaks herself in the language of moral superiority and kindness, making her seem like a virtuous leader. Her downfall is that, in truth, her pursuit of virtue has become an excuse for her own authoritarianism and ego.

5\. \*\*Moral Complexity:\*\* Valeria is not a straightforward villain. In her mind, she is doing what is right for humanity. This makes her a \*\*morally complex\*\* character, as her motivations are not entirely selfish. She believes that she is saving people from their own moral failings—even if it means using violent or oppressive means to do so.

\### \*\*Key Character Arc:\*\*

Valeria’s arc will explore the tension between her \*\*idealized vision of virtue\*\* and the reality of her oppressive actions. Over the course of the story, her \*\*delusion of righteousness\*\* will unravel as the consequences of her tyranny begin to outweigh the “moral good” she claims to seek. Heroes may confront her with her hypocrisy, forcing her to face the fact that she has \*\*betrayed the very virtues\*\* she claims to uphold. However, her downfall will not come through self-realization—Valeria will remain blind to her corruption until the very end, steadfast in her belief that she is the savior of humanity.

Her ultimate defeat will symbolize the \*\*failure of moral absolutism\*\* when virtues are corrupted for the sake of control and domination. As her regime crumbles, Valeria’s façade of virtue will collapse with it, revealing the hollow, authoritarian figure she has become. In the end, she will face the truth: that her pursuit of virtue has led her far from it.
