1\. The Citadel (Corporate Headquarters and Security Zone)

Description: The Citadel is the fortress-like central district where corporate leaders, technocrats, and AI overseers manage the planet's industrial, economic, and political systems. Protected by militarized AI forces and surveillance drones, it is the very embodiment of an authoritarian security state. The Citadel is walled off from the rest of the Nexus by towering barriers, energy shields, and constant patrols.

Aesthetic Inspiration: Imagine Night City’s corporate zone merged with a totalitarian regime's command center. Tall, unmarked black towers pierce the skyline, surrounded by holographic billboards that broadcast corporate propaganda. AI-operated turrets and hovering drones ensure no unauthorized person enters.

Security Systems:

NeuroGrid Surveillance: Citizens entering the Citadel are subjected to neural scans, ensuring compliance with corporate policies. Unauthorized access to the Citadel can result in instant neural shutdowns or even worse—mind control via implanted chips.

AI Enforcers: Patrolling the Citadel are augmented security units, a blend of advanced robotics and human operators. They are equipped with lethal suppression capabilities, ensuring order is maintained at all times.

Authority Command Center: At the Citadel's core is the Authority Command Center, a massive bunker-like structure where the Cyber-Consulate—the AI council that rules Erebus Nexus—makes decisions. Only the highest-ranking humans and AI functionaries are permitted here.

Key Features:

Corporate Towers: The massive towers house the offices of the planet's most powerful corporations. Inside, executives make galaxy-wide decisions in data-rich VR boardrooms.

Black Markets in the Shadows: Despite the extreme security, an underworld thrives in the lower levels of the Citadel. A network of cyber-hackers and corporate spies engage in illicit deals, using backdoor neural connections to steal data from corporate titans.
