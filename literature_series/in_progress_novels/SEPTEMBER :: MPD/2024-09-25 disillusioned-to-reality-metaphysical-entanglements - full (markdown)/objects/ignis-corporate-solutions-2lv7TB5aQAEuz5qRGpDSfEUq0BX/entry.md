3\. Fire and Emergency Services: “Ignis Fire Response”

Tagline: “Safety, One Spark at a Time.”

————————

Ignis Corporate Solutions

Tagline: “Protection for All – Justice for Those Who Can Afford It.”

Service Types: Fire Response, Theft Protection, Insurance, and Legal Services

————————

1\. Bronze Basic

Cost: Low (barely affordable for working-class citizens)

Fire Response:

Service Level: Delayed and minimal. Response times range from 4-6 hours. Bronze subscribers receive manual fire suppression systems (basic fire extinguishers) delivered by drone, but on-site response teams are only dispatched if the fire threatens nearby high-priority clients or corporate property.

Coverage: Fires will be assessed for the cost-benefit of intervention. If it’s deemed that responding will not save significant value, Ignis will notify the client that no service will be provided.

Theft Protection:

Service Level: Slow and unreliable. Theft reports are taken through automated bots, and investigations are low-priority unless the stolen property is insured by Ignis. Most theft cases will be ignored or archived unless the customer upgrades their tier.

Theft Recovery: Ignis offers digital theft reports but does not guarantee physical recovery of stolen property without paying additional fees.

Insurance:

Coverage: Limited. The Bronze plan covers only partial losses, and the payout is minimal, often below the replacement cost of the damaged property. Fires, theft, and accidents are subject to high deductibles, making it unlikely that policyholders will receive much after deductibles and fees.

Claims Processing: Lengthy and bureaucratic, often taking months for claims to be processed. In many cases, clients will be rejected based on hidden clauses or fine print.

Legal Services:

Representation: Ignis provides sub-public defender-level attorneys, usually fresh out of law school or nearing disciplinary action. They handle basic legal proceedings with minimal care, often pushing clients to accept plea bargains regardless of their guilt.

Win Rate: Abysmally low. Clients are typically overlooked in favor of wealthier clients, and complex cases are dropped outright if they seem unprofitable.

————————

2\. Silver Standard

Cost: Moderate (middle-class access, but still unaffordable for many)

Fire Response:

Service Level: Moderate response times, ranging from 1-2 hours. Fire drones may be deployed to assess the situation before sending a crew. Silver subscribers get basic suppression teams, but responses prioritize protecting corporate assets over the client’s property.

Coverage: Ignis will cover some of the damage, but only if intervention begins in time. Clients can pre-purchase additional protections, which may increase response speed.

Theft Protection:

Service Level: Moderate, with response times of 48-72 hours. Investigations begin only after verified security footage is reviewed. Basic drones will scour nearby areas, but theft recovery is rare unless the item was insured.

Theft Recovery: Theft reports lead to mild investigations, but unless the thief is a low-class criminal, most high-end stolen property goes unrecovered.

Insurance:

Coverage: Decent, covering 70-80% of losses with lower deductibles than the Bronze tier. However, complex claims may still require additional processing fees, and full payout is rarely guaranteed.

Claims Processing: Faster than Bronze, but still requires weeks of back-and-forth with Ignis claims agents to receive compensation.

Legal Services:

Representation: Ignis provides average legal representation, typically middle-tier lawyers who specialize in basic criminal and civil cases. They can competently defend against small charges, but anything involving major legal battles may require an upgrade.

Win Rate: Decent, with around 30% success in minor cases. However, corporate-backed legal teams often overpower Silver-tier clients. Clients facing serious charges are advised to settle.

3\. Gold Shield

Cost: High (available to upper-middle-class citizens, often covered by corporate insurance)

Fire Response:

Service Level: High. Response times range from 30-45 minutes. Gold-tier clients receive drone-initiated fire suppression and an on-site team equipped with automated suppression technologies. Their homes are equipped with early warning systems that signal Ignis at the first sign of danger.

Coverage: Ignis will fully suppress fires, prioritizing high-value properties. Damage control teams will handle clean-up, ensuring a 50-70% salvage rate for most properties.

Theft Protection:

Service Level: Excellent, with 15-30 minute response times. Ignis deploys high-end drones and AI trackers to trace and recover stolen property. Investigations are thorough, and recovery rates for insured items are high.

Theft Recovery: Full recovery attempts are made. Real-time data tracking ensures that most thieves are apprehended, and digital forensics are employed to trace stolen digital property.

Insurance:

Coverage: Generous, covering 85-95% of all damages, with minimal deductibles. Fires, accidents, and theft are covered, with expedited claims processing. Clients can opt for full restoration of properties through Ignis’s corporate contractors.

Claims Processing: Fast-tracked processing, often completed within days. Claims are prioritized, and agents work directly with corporate partners to ensure timely payouts.

Legal Services:

Representation: Gold Shield clients receive seasoned attorneys, often with corporate connections, ensuring excellent defense in both criminal and civil cases. These lawyers can handle complex litigation, protecting their clients from major charges.

Win Rate: Very high, with an 80-90% clearance rate for most cases. Clients facing charges are often able to settle out of court, or their charges are reduced to minor infractions through corporate influence.

4\. Platinum Apex

Cost: Astronomically high (accessible only to the wealthiest elites and corporate executives)

Fire Response:

Service Level: Immediate. Platinum Apex clients have fire response drones stationed near their properties at all times. Ignis teams are pre-deployed to high-risk locations and are capable of quelling fires within 5-10 minutes of ignition. The entire process is handled with zero client involvement, and damage is virtually non-existent.

Coverage: Fires are fully prevented through advanced Ignis technologies, including AI-triggered suppression fields. Platinum clients’ properties are fitted with fireproofing systems, ensuring near-zero risk of fire damage.

Theft Protection:

Service Level: Instantaneous response. Ignis deploys elite tactical teams and surveillance AIs to track and apprehend thieves before they even escape the scene. Most theft attempts are neutralized in real-time.

Theft Recovery: 100% recovery rate for insured items. Ignis uses advanced scanning technologies to track stolen goods across the city, and even off-world if necessary. Platinum clients have access to predictive AI surveillance that identifies potential theft threats before they occur.

Insurance:

Coverage: Full protection for any and all damages. Clients receive comprehensive coverage, including accidental damage, natural disasters, and theft recovery. There are no deductibles, and Ignis provides on-site reconstruction for any lost property.

Claims Processing: Immediate processing with personal representatives who handle all claims within hours. Clients never have to wait for compensation, and Ignis pre-emptively prevents damage whenever possible.

Legal Services:

Representation: Platinum Apex clients receive the best attorneys in Erebus Nexus, including legal teams that specialize in corporate law, criminal defense, and international litigation. These lawyers often have direct influence over legal rulings, and Ignis ensures that their clients are cleared of 99.99% of charges, no matter how severe.

Win Rate: Near-total impunity. Clients are typically cleared of charges before their cases even reach trial, often by leveraging corporate pressure on judges and law enforcement. Platinum clients can rewrite contracts, ensuring legal victory in nearly every scenario.

Corporate-Controlled Justice and Public Impact

Ignis Corporate Solutions is a hyper-capitalist service provider designed to give the wealthiest citizens of Erebus Nexus total protection and legal immunity, while the lower classes are left to struggle with basic services that barely function. Ignis presents itself as a benevolent service provider, offering “safety” and “justice” to the entire population, but its true purpose is to extract wealth from the populace while ensuring that the elite remain protected and above the law.

For the average citizen, the illusion of safety is maintained through constant advertisements and media campaigns, showing Ignis’s elite-level services in glamorous light. However, the reality is that the lower tiers provide next to nothing, while the upper echelons of society enjoy near-total corporate protection.
