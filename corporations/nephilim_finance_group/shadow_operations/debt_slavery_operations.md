   - Target vulnerable populations and struggling businesses
   - Use AI to identify potential victims based on financial and psychological profiles

2. **Systemic Debt Traps**
   - Lobby for reduced consumer protections and bankruptcy options
   - Create complex financial products that obfuscate true costs
   - Implement automated systems to maximize fees and penalties

3. **Debt Collection and Enforcement**
