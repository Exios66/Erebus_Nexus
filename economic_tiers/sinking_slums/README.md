# Sinking Slums

## Overview

The Sinking Slums, also known as the Undercity, form the lowest habitable layer of Erebus Nexus. This tier is characterized by extreme poverty, makeshift infrastructure, and a constant struggle for survival. Despite the harsh conditions, the Sinking Slums are home to a resilient population that has developed unique economic and social structures to cope with their challenging environment.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Improvised Living Spaces**: Homes and businesses are often cobbled together from salvaged materials and outdated technology.
2. **Resource Scarcity**: Access to basic necessities like clean water, food, and energy is limited and unreliable.
3. **Alternative Economies**: The tier operates on a mix of barter systems and local scrip currencies, with little access to the official economies of upper tiers.
4. **High Crime Rate**: Gang activity and black markets are prevalent due to limited law enforcement presence.
5. **Environmental Hazards**: Pollution, structural instability, and exposure to industrial waste from upper tiers are constant threats.

## Relationship with Other Tiers

The Sinking Slums have a complex relationship with the rest of Erebus Nexus:

- They receive discarded materials and outdated technology from upper tiers, which are repurposed for local use.
- Some residents find precarious employment in the Machine Layer above.
- The tier serves as a source of cheap labor and a testing ground for experimental technologies from upper tiers.
- Criminal networks in the Sinking Slums often have connections reaching into higher tiers.

## Challenges and Conflicts

Life in the Sinking Slums is fraught with numerous challenges:

- Constant threat of structural collapse and "sinking" further into uninhabitable areas
- Struggles with disease outbreaks due to poor sanitation and limited healthcare
- Conflicts between rival gangs over limited resources and territory
- Exploitation by upper tier corporations and criminal organizations
- The psychological toll of living in a perpetual state of scarcity and danger
