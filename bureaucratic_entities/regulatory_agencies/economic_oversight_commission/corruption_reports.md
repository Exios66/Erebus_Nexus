# Internal Memo: Corruption within the Galactic Economic Oversight Commission

## Classified - Eyes Only

From: [REDACTED]
To: Shadow Coordination Bureau Leadership
Date: 4242.230

### Overview

This report details the extent of our infiltration and manipulation of the Galactic Economic Oversight Commission (GEOC). Our efforts have successfully compromised the integrity of this regulatory body, ensuring it serves our interests while maintaining a facade of legitimacy.

### Key Achievements

1. **Leadership Control**
   - 3 out of 5 GEOC board members are our assets
   - The GEOC Chairman is fully compromised and under our influence

2. **Policy Manipulation**
   - Successfully implemented 17 policies that favor our corporate partners
   - Blocked 23 regulations that would have hindered our operations

3. **Enforcement Sabotage**
   - Redirected 70% of enforcement resources to target our competitors
   - Buried 12 major investigations into our activities

4. **Data Manipulation**
   - Altered economic reports to mask market manipulations
   - Implemented backdoors in GEOC's AI analysis systems

### Ongoing Operations

1. **Project Blind Eye**
   - Goal: Further reduce GEOC's ability to detect our market manipulations
   - Status: 60% complete, expected full implementation by Q3 4243

2. **Operation Trojan Horse**
   - Goal: Place our deep-cover agents in key technical positions
   - Status: 3 agents successfully embedded, 2 more in process

3. **Initiative Clean Slate**
   - Goal: Purge all records of our past violations from GEOC databases
   - Status: 85% complete, remaining 15% require higher-level access

### Challenges and Mitigation

1. **Whistleblower Threat**
   - Issue: Junior analyst showing signs of moral conflict
   - Mitigation: Monitoring closely, prepared to discredit or eliminate if necessary

2. **External Audit**
   - Issue: Upcoming independent audit could expose some operations
   - Mitigation: Bribing audit team leaders, preparing false documentation

### Future Plans

1. Expand our influence to lower levels of GEOC for more granular control
2. Implement quantum-encrypted communication channels for our assets within GEOC
3. Explore possibilities of using GEOC's authority to legally attack our competitors

### Conclusion

The GEOC remains a valuable tool in our arsenal, providing a veneer of legitimacy to our economic operations while actively suppressing threats to our interests. Continued investment in maintaining and expanding our control is highly recommended.
