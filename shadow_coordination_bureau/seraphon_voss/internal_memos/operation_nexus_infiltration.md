From: Seraphon Voss
To: SCB Inner Circle
Date: 2077 // 09.09.Q4

Colleagues,

Our efforts to infiltrate key positions within the Galactic Nexus government have progressed significantly. This memo outlines our current status and next steps.

### Achievements

1. Successfully placed Agent Sigma as senior advisor to the Nexus President.
2. Compromised 60% of the Galactic Senate through blackmail and bribery.
3. Installed backdoors in the Nexus Central AI system.

### Challenges

1. Increased scrutiny from independent watchdog groups.
2. Potential whistleblower in the Nexus Intelligence Agency.

### Next Steps

1. Accelerate the discreditation of watchdog groups through our media assets.
2. Eliminate the potential whistleblower (Natalia, please handle this discreetly).
3. Begin phase 2 of the AI system corruption to influence policy decisions.

Remember, our goal is total control without visible fingerprints. Maintain extreme caution in all communications and operations.
