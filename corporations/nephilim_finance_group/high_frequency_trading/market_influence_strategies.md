- Exploit this information to front-run trades and profit from price movements

### 2. Quote Stuffing

- Overwhelm competing traders by flooding the market with rapid-fire orders and cancellations
- Create artificial latency in the market to gain microsecond advantages

### 3. Momentum Ignition

- Initiate a series of trades to create the illusion of market movement
- Profit from the resulting price changes as other market participants react

### 4. Layering and Spoofing

- Place and quickly cancel large orders to manipulate the order book
- Influence other traders' perceptions of supply and demand

### 5. Pinging
