- Some lower-tier communities have developed offline voting methods to bypass electronic manipulation

## Ethical Implications

The widespread use of these tactics raises serious ethical questions about the nature of democracy in Erebus Nexus and the right of citizens to free and fair elections. The tension between The Council's desire for control and the populace's desire for genuine representation remains a central conflict in Nexus society.

Understanding these election manipulation strategies is crucial for anyone seeking to navigate the complex political landscape of Erebus Nexus, whether as a player within the system or as part of the resistance against it.
