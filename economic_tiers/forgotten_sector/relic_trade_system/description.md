# The Relic Trade System of the Forgotten Sector

## Overview

The Relic Trade System (RTS) is the primary economic model of the Forgotten Sector in Erebus Nexus. This unique system is built around the discovery, valuation, and exchange of relics - artifacts, technologies, and resources left behind from earlier eras of the megacity's history. The RTS reflects the sector's nature as a treasure trove of forgotten knowledge and dangerous secrets.

## Key Features

### 1. Relic-Based Currency

While some traditional forms of currency are used, the primary medium of exchange in the Forgotten Sector is relics themselves. The value of a relic is determined by its rarity, functionality, historical significance, and potential applications.

### 2. Auction Houses

Central to the RTS are various auction houses where relics are showcased, evaluated, and traded. These range from established, semi-legitimate operations to clandestine, invite-only events.

### 3. Relic Authentication

A crucial aspect of the RTS is the authentication and valuation of relics. Skilled authenticators play a vital role in the economy, using their expertise to determine the origin, function, and worth of discovered items.

### 4. Risk-Reward Dynamics

The value of relics is intrinsically tied to the danger involved in their retrieval. Items from more hazardous areas of the sector often command higher prices.

### 5. Knowledge Economy

Information about potential relic locations, their functions, or historical context is itself a valuable commodity within the RTS.

## Functionality

1. **Relic Expeditions**: Organized ventures into unexplored or dangerous areas of the sector to retrieve valuable relics.

2. **Trading Networks**: Complex networks of traders, middlemen, and buyers facilitate the movement of relics within and beyond the Forgotten Sector.

3. **Relic Restoration**: Skilled technicians work to restore functionality to damaged relics, often significantly increasing their value.

4. **Cross-Tier Transactions**: Some high-value relics find their way to upper tiers through secretive deals and black market connections.

5. **Relic-Backed Loans**: Some operators in the sector offer loans or credit based on the promise of future relic discoveries.

## Impact on Forgotten Sector Society
