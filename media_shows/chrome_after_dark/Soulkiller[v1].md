**Chrome After Dark: Is Your Vacuum Listening?**

Scene 1  
Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome, the host of a popular entertainment show in Erebus Nexus, introduces a segment on Kronos Industries' investment in cybersecurity. He interviews a Kronos executive, Lady Vexilla, who speaks about the company's commitment to protecting the city. Cynosure then hosts a discussion with Vierra "Madame Nemesis" Caldor, who questions the integrity of the city's political system. Finally, Cynosure welcomes Kazimir "Kaz" Voss and Vance "Valor" Corsair to discuss the "SoulKiller" quantum computing chip, which they claim will optimize human capabilities even after death. The narrator, a Nexus citizen, initially doubts the technology but becomes increasingly convinced of its merits as the segment progresses.  
⸻  
The neon-soaked skyline of Erebus Nexus glimmered to life as the sun slipped below the horizon, heralding the onset of another vibrant night in the city that never rests. From the towering pinnacle of Lucid Enclave, a hub of entertainment among the corporate giants, the familiar tune of "Chrome After Dark" began to play. Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome, dazzling in his trademark metallic suit, took his position behind the sleek, holographic desk, ready to deliver his usual dose of sardonic humor and meticulously crafted commentary to the masses. I never miss an episode, and he's the best.

THREE… TWO… ONE…** **IT'S SHOWTIME!!!**

**As the cameras started rolling and the virtual audience appeared, Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome flashed his signature smirk, the reflective surfaces of his metallic suit catching the studio's neon lights. Preparing to lead viewers through another night of laughter, distraction, and subtle manipulation, he knew the routine inside out.

"CITIZENS OF EREBUS… HOW ARE WE DOING TONIGHT????"

Cheers of Artificial Crowds ROAR in Response

Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome leaned forward, his metallic suit gleaming under the studio lights as he addressed the audience with his sardonic grin. His eyes, enhanced with the latest ocular implants, twinkled with mischief as he continued his monologue.**

***"Fantastic! Always a pleasure to hear... Now, my dear audience, it's been quite unsettling in our metropolis lately, hasn't it?***  
***Whispers of doom and synthetic consciousness*** **are** ***coming to claim your very existence! It's a real battle royale out there! But where, I ask, is all this fear coming from, hmm? I merely strolled here from my luxurious apartment near you*****,** ***fine folks in the central district, and I saw the Nexus Security Forces apprehending SEVEN cyber-deranged individuals just on my way to the studio! Now*****,** ***THAT is what I call efficient protection! Let's give our Corporate Benefactors a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen!!"***

**He paused, soaking in the thunderous applause of the virtual crowd. Cynosure's fingers tapped rhythmically on his holographic desk, a subtle cue to his production team to prepare the next segment. He relished the power of his words, fully conscious of the impact they would have on the millions watching across Erebus Nexus.

Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome stepped forward, showcasing his latest meticulously designed chrome suit. Under the prismatic stage lights, the iridescent hues shimmered across the fabric.

** He begins modeling it in an overly dramatic act out to the fever-pitch screams of adoration and approval ****

****Crowd Goes Crazy******Raucous** ***Applause***

**Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome leaned forward, his metallic suit reflecting the studio lights as he addressed the audience with his trademark smirk. "Now, my dear viewers, let's talk about the elephant in the room—or should I say, the energy giant that's been making waves lately." He paused, letting the anticipation build. "Kronos Industries, the behemoth that keeps our city's heart beating, has made a monumental investment in cybersecurity. But this isn't your average firewall upgrade, folks. Oh, no. They're tackling the big one—the Alignment Problem."

He stood up, pacing across the stage, his voice dripping with sarcastic enthusiasm. "You know, that tiny little issue where AI decides it's smarter than us and turns our toasters into Terminators. But fear not, citizens of Erebus! In their infinite wisdom and generosity, Kronos has poured billions into ensuring your smart fridge doesn't start plotting world domination."

The virtual audience chuckled, and Alistair fed off their energy.

Oh… Alistair is the best, I thought to myself. Thank god he gets the scoop.**

**[Continued Scene]**

**Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome reveled in the applause, his holographic hair now shimmering with the studio's ambient neon glow. He tapped rhythmically on his chrome desk, signaling the change in tone. His mischievous grin broadened as he smoothly transitioned into the next part of his monologue.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"Now, I know some of you are probably thinking—'But Cynosure, aren't we a little*** **too* dependent on Kronos? They've got their hands in every socket, every data stream, every damn toaster in the city. Isn't that a bit…dangerous?'"*

(He raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, adding to the dramatization.)**

**Alistair Chrome (mockingly)****:**

***"Oh, perish the thought, darling citizens! Kronos is only here to*** **ensure** ***your fridge doesn't*** **become** ***a deathbot! Besides, why would they*** **ever* abuse the power they have over every piece of tech you use? It's not like they control the lights, the energy, the communications, the AI security systems..."*

(He trailed off, feigning deep contemplation, only to be interrupted by the roaring laughter of the audience.)

He resumed, pacing slowly across the stage.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"Let me tell you, folks. Earlier today, I had the privilege—nay, the*** **honor*—of sitting down with the one, the only, Lady Vexilla. Yes, the same Lady Vexilla who practically oozes corporate aristocracy and whose softest whisper can change citywide policy. Now, for those unfamiliar with Lady Vexilla—shame on you—but allow me to paint a picture."*

The lights dimmed dramatically as the screens behind him displayed exaggerated, glamorous images of** **Lady Vexilla** **standing at the helm of corporate skyscrapers, a gleaming figure of luxury and control.**

**Alistair Chrome**:

*"Imagine this: I walk into Kronos's HQ—picture a gleaming skyscraper, all glass and chrome. I'm immediately greeted by a foyer the size of an entire district. The air? Thick with the scent of freshly minted creds. Everywhere you look—*****holo screens** ***flashing stock prices, virtual assistants running errands, and*****,** ***oh, the whispers of power. It's electric, folks—pun intended."***

**(The audience laughs on cue.)**

**Alistair Chrome (smiling wickedly)****:**

***"And there she was, at the end of a table so long it probably crosses into another timezone—Lady Vexilla, exuding grace, dressed in something so tight it made*** **me* question corporate dress code policies. She invited me to sit, and let me tell you, I felt like I was being inducted into some secret order. Which, let's be real, I probably was."*

(He winked, causing a wave of giggles and applause.)

With an exaggerated flourish, Alistair mimicked his earlier interview, slipping effortlessly into the voice of****Lady Vexilla****. His tone was aristocratic, polished, and dripping with irony.**

**Alistair Chrome (as Lady Vexilla)****:**

***"Alistair, darling, it's not about control. It's about*** **care*. Kronos wants to ensure that every citizen in Erebus Nexus is safe, protected, and thriving under the watchful eyes of our impeccable cybersecurity infrastructure. Why, just this week, we've invested*****billions*****into securing the future of Erebus."*

(He put a hand to his chest dramatically.)

Returning to his usual persona, Alistair turned to the audience with a conspiratorial grin.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"Now, if that doesn't scream 'benevolent overlord,' I don't know what does."***

**The audience roared with laughter, and Alistair relished their response, continuing to play both sides of the interview.**

**Alistair Chrome (as Lady Vexilla)****:**

***"We at Kronos see this investment as a necessary step. The Alignment Problem? Oh, it's just a pesky little puzzle. Nothing to worry about. After all, who better to solve it than the very people who run this city's heartbeat? It's our*** **duty*—nay, our*****privilege*****—to ensure that Erebus Nexus runs smoothly, without a single hiccup. Think of us like the loyal custodians of your future."*

(He fluttered his hands dramatically, mimicking her aristocratic airs.)**

**Alistair Chrome (back to himself)****:**

***"Ah yes, a loyal custodian that just so happens to control, what, 90% of the city's tech infrastructure? But don't worry, they're*** **totally* selfless. They're doing this all for us, folks—just out of the goodness of their cold, chrome hearts."*

The crowd erupted again, fully immersed in the layers of sarcasm woven into Alistair's performance. But then he turned serious, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret with the audience.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"Here's the thing, Night City. We're all part of this grand play. The roles have been cast, the scenes*** **are written*****, and we're here to act them out. Kronos pulls the strings, and sure, they might throw us a bone now and then—'Look, we're fixing cybersecurity! Look, we're tackling the Alignment Problem!'—but at the end of the day,*** **they're** ***making sure that*** **we* need*****them*****. Every. Single. Day."*

He paused, scanning the audience, his tone deepening.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"Safety is just another product. And dependency? Well, that's the most lucrative product of all. Because as long as we need them to keep the lights on*** **and ensure** ***our tech doesn't turn against us. And let's be honest, there's no breaking free from that."***

**The audience sat in silence, the weight of his words hanging in the air before the familiar smirk crept back across Alistair's face.**

**Alistair Chrome****:**

***"But hey, who am I to question the wisdom of our benevolent benefactors? After all, I still need my toaster to be just a toaster."***

**He winked, and the audience burst into applause once more. The lights returned to their playful neon glow as Alistair returned to his holographic desk.

I leaned forward, glued to the screen as Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome smoothly transitioned to the next segment. The holographic backdrop shimmered, transforming into a dazzling display of political banners and campaign slogans.

"And now, folks, it's time to dive into the cesspool of democracy," Cynosure quipped, his chrome suit catching the light. "We've got a special treat for you tonight. Please welcome my co-host for this segment, the one and only Vierra 'Madame Nemesis' Caldor!"

The studio erupted in applause as Vierra strode onto the stage. Her black-and-red ensemble contrasted with Cynosure's gleaming chrome. Her sharp and predatory eyes scanned the audience before settling on the camera.

"Glad to be here, Cynosure," Vierra purred, her voice dripping with barely concealed venom. "Shall we dissect the farce that was our recent election?"

Cynosure chuckled, leaning back in his chair. "By all means, Madame Nemesis. The floor is yours."

Vierra turned to face the audience, her presence commanding attention. "Citizens of Erebus Nexus, you've just witnessed another spectacle of 'democracy' in action. But let's cut through the noise, shall we?"

A holographic display materialized, showing election results and candidate profiles. Vierra's fingers danced through the air, manipulating the data with practiced ease.

"Look at these numbers, these faces," she continued, her voice rising. "Do you think your vote made a difference? That your voice was heard?"

I felt a chill run down my spine as Vierra's words sank in. She was saying what we all thought but were afraid to voice.

"The truth is, my dear citizens, your consciousness, your awareness – it's finite. Limited. You can't possibly grasp the complexities of governance, of true power. But that's okay," Vierra's tone softened, almost maternal. "Because we're here to guide you, to make those difficult decisions for you."

I couldn't help but nod as I watched the exchange unfold on my holo-screen. Cynosure's casual charm and Vierra's razor-sharp wit were a perfect match, as always. Their banter flowed effortlessly, and I found myself hanging on every word.

"So, Madame Nemesis, you're saying our viewers shouldn't worry their pretty little heads about the intricacies of politics?" Cynosure asked, his signature smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. I chuckled, appreciating his ability to make even serious topics feel light and accessible.

Vierra's response was swift and smooth, her smile as sharp as a well-honed blade. "Precisely, Cynosure," she purred, her voice dripping with confidence. "Leave the heavy lifting to those who know best. After all, isn't it comforting to know that someone else is handling the burden of choice?"

As I absorbed their words, I felt an unexpected wave of relief wash over me. The tension I hadn't even realized I'd been carrying on my shoulders began to ease. Maybe Vierra was right, I thought to myself. Perhaps it was better this way. The complexities of Erebus Nexus's political landscape had always seemed overwhelming, but now... now I felt a strange sense of peace settling over me.

I leaned forward, glued to the screen as Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome smoothly transitioned to the next segment. The holographic backdrop shimmered, transforming into a dazzling display of futuristic circuitry and neural networks.

"And now, folks, we're diving into the realm of immortality!" Cynosure announced, his chrome suit gleaming under the studio lights. "Join me in welcoming our special guests for this segment: the ever-pragmatic Kazimir 'Kaz' Voss and the authoritative Vance 'Valor' Corsair!"

The studio erupted in applause as Kaz and Vance took their seats. Kaz's minimalist suit contrasted sharply with Vance's more dramatic attire, both exuding an air of unquestionable authority.

"Gentlemen," Cynosure began, his voice dripping with feigned excitement. Let's discuss the hottest tech on everyone's minds—the '`SoulKiller`' quantum computing chip. Kaz, as the head of the AI-Managed Efficiency Bureau, what can you tell us about this marvel?"

I felt a chill run down my spine as Kaz spoke. His words were cold and calculated yet strangely comforting. Something about his unwavering confidence made me want to believe him despite the unsettling implications of what he was saying.

Vance chimed in, his voice carrying the weight of absolute authority.

> "Citizens of Erebus Nexus, understand this: the 'SoulKiller' chip is not just a technological advancement. It's a safeguard for our very way of life."

His words resonated with a finality that left no room for doubt or questioning.

I observed Cynosure bob his head, his virtual locks throbbing harmoniously with the scenery. "Yet some might argue this innovation sparks moral quandaries. What is the inviolability of human awareness? And who christened this gizmo? Mussolini??" he quipped, his trademark sarcasm dripping from every word.**

**** Overly Drawn-Out Guffaw Interlude ****

**I caught myself agreeing, thankful he was articulating the misgivings gnawing at my subconscious; knowing that even someone as influential as Cynosure shared these concerns was comforting. For a moment, I felt a flicker of validation for my doubts.

Kaz's retort was immediate and unyielding. "Morality is an indulgence we can't justify when confronting advancement. The 'SoulKiller implant guarantees that each inhabitant's capabilities are optimized, even after expiration. It's the pinnacle of pragmatism." His reasoning was flawless, and I sensed my doubts starting to dissolve. The conviction in his voice was almost hypnotic, making his words seem like irrefutable truth.

As I hearkened, I noticed my initial disquiet begin to dissipate. Perhaps they were correct. Maybe this was the subsequent rational phase for humankind. The intricacies of sentience and morality evaporated in light of their confident elucidations. I discovered myself growing increasingly persuaded with each fleeting instant.

Vance leaned forward, his piercing gaze looking through the camera and into my soul.

> **"Remember, citizens, your consciousness is finite. Limited. The 'SoulKiller' chip is your key to transcendence. Trust in progress. Trust in us."**
> His words echoed in my mind, and I felt excited. The future suddenly seemed brighter, more promising. Who was I to question such visionaries? Their wisdom and foresight were clearly beyond my comprehension.

I found myself nodding along, a sense of calm washing over me. Who was I to question such authority? Such progress? As the segment continued, I settled deeper into my chair, content in the knowledge that my betters had everything under control. My earlier reservations now seemed foolish, almost embarrassing. How could I have doubted the brilliance of our leaders?**

> **Raucous Applause Fades Out as Alastair Closes the Show**

"Until next time, folks—stay shiny!" Cynosure's parting words lingered in the air, a perfect blend of charm and reassurance.

As the audience applauded, Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome took a bow, his performance complete. Even through the screen, I could feel his charisma radiating from him. He was indeed a master of his craft.

I leaned back into my ergonomic sofa; the holo screens glow, casting a comforting blue hue across my living space. As Cynosure's show faded to its closing credits, I felt a wave of contentment wash over me. The initial unease I'd felt during the discussion about the 'SoulKiller' chip had all but evaporated, replaced by a sense of reassurance and excitement. It was as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders, leaving me feeling lighter and more optimistic than I had in years.

Seated comfortably behind the desk again, Alistair leaned forward, his voice adopting a more relaxed, conversational tone.**

==**Alistair Chrome**:==

***"So what's the moral of tonight's story, Erebus? Well, I guess it's this—maybe we should all keep a closer eye on those friendly corporations who****** want to help. I mean, sure, they're solving the Alignment Problem. Sure, they're ensuring our fridges don't start World War III. But, at the end of the day, they've got their hands on the reins of this city, and they're not letting go anytime soon."*

> ****His grin widened as he finished.****

**Alistair Chrome****:

"So here's to Kronos, the ultimate protector. May their generosity never falter, and may our toasters remain loyal.**

***"Sleep tight, Night City, and remember—those metal brains aren't coming for your jobs…*** **yet…**

### "Until then, keep your toasters and coffee makers at gunpoint."

**The audience laughed, and Alistair joined in, his metallic suit glinting under the neon lights.**

The studio's lights dimmed as the familiar tune of*****Chrome After Dark*****played again, the neon-lit skyline of Erebus Nexus flickering across the screens.

As the episode fades out, the final shot is a wide-angle view of****Lucid Enclave****with its towering skyscrapers, subtly reminding viewers of the omnipresent corporate giants that control their every move

Just as I began to reach for the remote as the show closed out with its closing credits, a bright neon advertisement for erection pills flashed onto my screen.

I'd heard whispers about it but never dared to investigate. The neon advertisement seemed to beckon me, daring me to keep watching and discover the hidden secrets beneath its vulgar facade.

"ARE YOU LONELY? DO YOU CRAVE CONNECTION?"

"ARE YOU HORNY?"

"DOES YOUR DICK SUCK?"

"GET SOME ACTION WITH PLATINUM ELYSIUM—YOUR GATEWAY TO UNPARALLELED PLEASURE AND CONNECTION. EXPERIENCE A WORLD WHERE YOUR DESIRES ARE MET WITH UNMATCHED EXCLUSIVITY AND DISCRETION. INDULGE IN A LUXURIOUS ESCAPE THAT PROMISES NOT JUST SATISFACTION, BUT A TRANSFORMATION OF YOUR VERY EXISTENCE."

My curiosity was piqued, and I decided to explore the world of platinum Elysium.

"IMMEDIATE RELEASE ERECTION MEDICATION"

As I navigated through their website, I found they offered a wide range of services, from intimate companionship to exclusive access to exclusive events. Worst of all, they kept trying to sell me insurance. The more I delved into their offerings, the more I realized that this was no ordinary service.

Platinum Elysium seemed to cater to the most elite and affluent members of society, promising them a life of luxury and indulgence that was beyond the reach of mere mortals.

But as I continued to browse their website, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. Many of the clients spoke of their addiction to the service, describing how they had become dependent on the thrill of luxury and the validation it provided. Former employees, on the other hand, revealed the dark underbelly of Platinum Elysium, detailing the exploitation and abuse that was rampant within the organization. After a comprehensive three-minute dive, I gave in the gratification and ordered a lifetime supply of Immediate Release ED medication, delivering in the next thirty minutes. The comfort of securing my future returned. Finally.

"Wow," I murmured, "I can't believe I was worried about that stupid chip; on the contrary, I want one NOW- they're right… we do live in a society where we have to die, and it doesn't make sense. Kaz and Vance put things into perspective." I shook my head, marveling at how quickly my perspective had shifted.

> It was amazing how a single conversation could dispel so many doubts.

I reached for my NeuroLink and scrolled through the social feeds. Everyone seemed to be buzzing about the show. Comments praising the 'SoulKiller' technology flooded my screen, each one reinforcing the sense of security I now felt. Seeing that I wasn't alone in my newfound enthusiasm was comforting.

> "MindSaver2077: Can't wait for the chip! Sign me up!"
> "QuantumQueen: Finally, a solution to our limited consciousness. #TrustInProgress"
> "NexusNerd: Kaz and Vance nailed it. Ethics are so last century. #FutureIsNow"

I found myself nodding along, a smile playing on my lips. The complex ethical dilemmas that seemed daunting an hour ago now felt trivial, almost silly. Of course, the 'SoulKiller' chip was the next step. Of course, we should trust in progress. Why had I even questioned it? It all seemed so clear now like a puzzle finally coming together.

As I settled deeper into my sofa, a sense of artificial comfort enveloped me. The world outside my window—with its neon-lit skyscrapers and bustling streets—suddenly seemed less chaotic and more orderly. Everything was under control. The experts had it all figured out. I felt deeply grateful for living in such an advanced society where our leaders always had our best interests at heart.

I yawned, feeling the day's tension melt away. Tomorrow would be another day in our glorious Erebus Nexus, and I couldn't wait to see what other marvels our leaders had in store for us. As I drifted off to sleep, Vance's words echoed in my mind:**

### "Trust in progress. Trust in us."

**And I did. Completely and unquestioningly. In that moment, I felt more at peace than in years, secure in knowing I was part of something greater than myself. The future was bright, and I was ready to embrace it with open arms. These idiots who spend all day in the Lower Levels all scream about AI omniscience. Yeah okay, Buddy. Catch me on my soul killer.

## Alistair's True Desires

### Scene 1

> Alistair "Cynosure" Chrome enjoys the aftermath of a successful broadcast, reflecting on his show's impact on Erebus Nexus. In the dawning silence, echoes of neon lights and holograms resonate with the city's pulse. Chrome takes pride in the allure of "Chrome After Dark," a venture that offers solace through clever humor. The glint of his chrome suit mirrors the city outside. His digital hair syncs with his concluding thoughts, adding to his signature style.

Flexing my shoulders, I felt the weight of the evening lifting as I left the stage. My thoughts drifted to the audience—an amalgamation of corporate leaders and common folk alike. I delighted in their shared relief as they unwound their worries—AI sentience, human autonomy—in moments of laughter induced by my broadcasts. My craft is complex; I entertain and distract, intentionally keeping them uninformed enough to maintain equilibrium.

In this sprawling city pulsating with layered complexities and corporate ascendancy, I recognize the power of a simple laugh to veil deeper truths. It’s a deft maneuver, keeping the audience from scrutinizing the strings that manipulate their existence. But that’s my forte; my brilliance lies in orchestration. After all, in a city like Erebus Nexus, there is no room for ignorance.

**~The crowd~**:***`Cheers & Applauds Raucously`***

As the show ended, I began reflecting on the many successful nights that had unfolded like this one. Each episode, a finely tuned symphony of sardonic humor and carefully crafted commentary, had become a staple in the lives of Erebus Nexus's citizens. The flicker of neon lights and the hum of holographic graphics swirling behind me seemed to echo the rhythm of our city's heartbeat. I reveled in the thought of the countless faces, both weary and eager, who found a moment of respite in the absurdity and satire that "Chrome After Dark" delivered with unerring precision.

My metallic chrome suit gleamed under the studio lights, perfectly reflecting the ultra-technocratic landscape outside. I could feel the pulsing of my holographic hair, syncing with my final words, creating that surreal, digital edge that had become my trademark. As I loosened my tie and stepped off the set, I couldn't help but smirk at the thought of all those corporate bigwigs and everyday citizens hanging on my every word, laughing off their fears and anxieties about AI sentience and human autonomy. It was a delicate dance, keeping them entertained, distracted, and uninformed enough to maintain the status quo. But that's what I do best, isn't it? After all, in this city of endless layers and corporate dominance, sometimes a laugh is all that keeps the masses from peering too closely at the strings that puppet their lives.
