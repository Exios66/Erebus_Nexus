Lord Chancellor Metis Kratos

Title: Head of the Central Authority of Order and Control (CAOC)

Symbolism: The Iron Fist of Law – Totalitarian control, order through dominance, and suppression of dissent.

Character Overview:

Metis Kratos is the cold, unyielding figurehead of the Central Authority of Order and Control, the most powerful government entity in Erebus Nexus. Kratos is known for his ruthless efficiency, maintaining total control over the populace through a combination of surveillance, militarized enforcement, and the systematic erasure of rebellion. His authority is absolute, symbolized by his brutal methods of governance, often referred to as “The Iron Fist.”

Kratos’s government department is responsible for maintaining order within Erebus Nexus, but it does so by enforcing extreme compliance with the corporate interests of Nexum and Tesseract. In reality, he is nothing more than a figurehead for corporate enforcers, his every decision dictated by the Triad Monopolies to ensure maximum profit extraction from the city’s citizens, while any form of dissent is crushed swiftly and without mercy.

Visual Symbolism and Appearance:

• Armor-like Attire: Kratos always appears in a suit of black, militaristic armor, resembling a hybrid between a corporate executive and a warlord. His suit is made from blackened steel, with jagged edges that mirror his harsh, dictatorial personality. The armor is covered in subtle circuitry, symbolizing his connection to the AI-driven surveillance grid that monitors Erebus Nexus.

• Facial Features: His face is always partially concealed by a reflective metal mask, leaving only his piercing red eyes visible, symbolizing the all-seeing eye of the state. His expression is permanently fixed in a grim, authoritarian stare, radiating control and intimidation.

• Weapon of Choice: Kratos carries a shock baton that doubles as a scepter of power, symbolizing both his ability to enforce law and his status as ruler. The scepter is embedded with corporate sigils, a subtle reminder of his true masters—Nexum and Tesseract.

Symbolic Role in Society:

• Embodiment of Control: Kratos represents the corporate-sponsored militarization of government, with the facade of maintaining public order when in reality he is the enforcer of corporate profit.

• Cultural Symbol: He is known as the “Black Fist,” a fearsome symbol throughout Erebus Nexus that represents the iron grip with which the government controls every aspect of daily life. His image is projected across neon billboards, with slogans like “Order Through Strength” and “Control for Prosperity,” conditioning the populace to accept their oppression.
