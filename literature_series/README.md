# Literature Series

This directory is dedicated to storing the narrative elements of the Erebus Nexus story, including acts, subplots, chapters, and scenes. It provides a structured framework for managing and developing the story.

## Structure

- **/act_1/**
  - **/chapters/** - Contains individual chapter files
  - **/subplots/** - Contains subplot files related to Act 1
  - **/scenes/** - Contains individual scene files for Act 1

- **/act_2/**
  - **/chapters/** - Contains individual chapter files
  - **/subplots/** - Contains subplot files related to Act 2
  - **/scenes/** - Contains individual scene files for Act 2

- **/in_progress_novels/** - Contains chapters and sections from specific novels that are currently in progress

## Purpose

This structure allows for organized storytelling and easy navigation through the narrative elements of the Erebus Nexus. Each act can contain multiple chapters, subplots, and scenes, providing a comprehensive view of the story's progression. The in_progress_novels directory provides a space for working on specific novels separately from the main structure.

## Usage

- Use the chapter files to outline and develop the main storyline for each act.
- Subplot files can be used to explore secondary storylines or character arcs that complement the main narrative.
- Scene files allow for detailed descriptions of specific moments or events within the story.
- The in_progress_novels directory is for storing and organizing work on specific novels that are still being developed.

Remember to maintain consistency across all narrative elements and ensure that subplots and scenes align with the overall story arc defined in the chapters. When novels in the in_progress_novels directory are completed, consider integrating them into the main act structure.
