# In-Progress Novels

This directory is dedicated to storing chapters and sections from specific novels that are currently in progress. It allows for separation from other worldbuilding elements while providing proper storage space for current work.

## Structure

Each novel in progress should have its own subdirectory. For example:

- `/novel_1/`
  - `chapter_1.md`
  - `chapter_2.md`
  - `notes.md`
- `/novel_2/`
  - `chapter_1.md`
  - `outline.md`

## Usage

- Create a new subdirectory for each novel you're working on.
- Use meaningful file names for chapters, sections, and any additional notes or outlines.
- Keep this area separate from the finalized content in the main act structure.

Remember to move or integrate completed work into the main literature series structure when appropriate.
