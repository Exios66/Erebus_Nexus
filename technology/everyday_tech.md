# Everyday Technology in Erebus Nexus

## Olympus Tier

In the Olympus Tier, the pinnacle of luxury and technological advancement, residents enjoy a seamless integration of cutting-edge technology into their daily lives.

- **Personal AI assistants**: These highly advanced AI companions manage every aspect of daily life, from scheduling and communication to personal security and entertainment. They are capable of learning and adapting to their owner's preferences, providing a personalized experience.
- **Holographic communication devices**: Holo-communicators allow for real-time, three-dimensional interaction with others, making distant communication feel as intimate as a face-to-face conversation. These devices are often embedded in walls or wearable accessories.
- **Automated smart homes with environmental control**: Homes in the Olympus Tier are equipped with sophisticated automation systems that regulate lighting, temperature, and even air quality. These systems can anticipate the needs of the residents, creating an optimal living environment at all times.

## Machine Layer

The Machine Layer is characterized by its focus on efficiency and productivity, with technology designed to enhance industrial and technical capabilities.

- **Industrial-grade augmented reality interfaces**: Workers use AR interfaces to overlay digital information onto the physical world, streamlining complex tasks and improving precision in manufacturing and maintenance. These interfaces are often integrated into helmets or goggles.
- **Energy credit management systems**: Residents rely on advanced systems to monitor and manage their energy consumption, ensuring that they stay within their allocated energy credits. These systems provide real-time feedback and suggestions for optimizing energy use.
- **Automated public transportation**: The transportation network in the Machine Layer is highly automated, with self-driving vehicles and trains that operate on precise schedules. These systems are designed to minimize delays and maximize efficiency, ensuring that workers can move quickly and reliably.

## Sinking Slums

In the Sinking Slums, technology is a matter of survival, with residents making do with whatever they can scavenge or repurpose from the upper tiers.

- **Scavenged and repurposed tech from upper tiers**: Residents are adept at finding discarded technology and giving it new life. This can include anything from old communication devices to broken machinery, which are repaired and modified to serve new purposes.
- **Basic cybernetic implants for survival and work**: Many inhabitants have rudimentary cybernetic enhancements, often self-installed or provided by underground clinics. These implants can range from simple prosthetics to more complex devices that enhance physical capabilities or provide medical support.
- **Makeshift communication networks**: With limited access to official communication channels, residents have created their own networks using a patchwork of old devices and improvised infrastructure. These networks are crucial for coordinating community efforts and sharing information.

## Sprawl

The Sprawl is a hub of creativity and resourcefulness, where residents rely on ingenuity and collaboration to meet their technological needs.

- **DIY tech solutions and community-shared devices**: Inhabitants often build their own devices or share resources within the community. This can include anything from homemade drones to communal 3D printers, fostering a culture of innovation and mutual support.
- **Recycled and refurbished technology from other tiers**: Technology from the upper tiers is frequently recycled and refurbished, providing the Sprawl with a steady supply of functional devices. This practice not only reduces waste but also ensures that technology remains accessible to all.
- **Open-source software and hardware projects**: The Sprawl is a hotbed for open-source development, with residents collaborating on software and hardware projects that are freely available to the community. These projects often address specific local needs and promote a spirit of collective problem-solving.

This overview showcases the disparity in everyday technology access across different tiers of Erebus Nexus, highlighting the unique ways in which each community adapts to its circumstances.
